# Tree-Meh VS Code Extension

**Extension Name**: Tree-Meh

**Summary**:
The Tree-Meh is a straight-forward and useful Visual Studio Code extension designed to simplify your project exploration, analysis, and documentation efforts. It empowers developers by providing an easy way to generate and copy a string representation of their project's directory structure directly to the clipboard.

With just a few clicks, you can capture the essence of your project's layout and share it seamlessly with others, enabling more productive discussions and collaborative brainstorming. Whether you're seeking to refactor, design, or communicate ideas about your project's architecture, this extension will become an staple of your developement toolkit.

**Example Use Cases**:

- **AI-Assisted Analysis**: Engage with AI assistants like ChatGPT to pitch your refactor or design ideas. Share the tree with AI to get insights, suggestions, and analysis.

- **Documentation After Refactoring**: Whether your project coding convention calls for a project directory representation in the docs or you're maintaining a legacy project, it can be a real pain to update these diagrams by hand. Even if leveraging the terminal command, the process of getting that output from a terminal into a README file can drive anyone bonkers. Now in two clips and a paste you can update the docuemntation seemlessly

- **Design Discussions**: Share your project's structure with team members during design discussions. Use the generated tree to provide context and highlight different architectural components.
